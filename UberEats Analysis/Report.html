id="h.5gtkl9z4k5tz"><span class="c23">Executive Summary / Abstract</span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Dear members of the board, </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">We are sharing this report and study detailing in the hopes of determining actionable strategies to improve our processes here at Uber EatsNew York City. While the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating to our world, the people, and global economies, certain industries, including ours, did manage to thrive due to the circumstances that the pandemic generated. In fact, during the opening months of the pandemic, when lockdowns were at their harshest, the top four food delivery apps &ldquo;raked in roughly $5.5 billion in combined revenue from April through September, more than twice as much as their combined $2.5 billion during the same period [the year prior]&rdquo; (Marketwatch). During this period, people around the world were stuck in their homes, restaurants were closed, and they thus depended on us to provide them with food from their favorite establishments. However, as the pandemic has continued to run its course people have slowly started to return to normal life and we have thus started to see a slow drop off from our productivity at the peak of the pandemic. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the changes we are continuing to see in the industry, and as people continue to slowly return to their normal lives, the company must continue to make changes in order to find continued growth and profitability. Through a study we seek to gain a better understanding of how our current, and potential future customers, feel about delivery apps, and ours in particular, in this new environment and certain tactics can further convince them to continue using our services. We have chosen three specific and distinct research questions to help focus our study and hopefully create actionable strategies that our platform can incorporate moving forward. More specifically, the strategies we are studying include the use of a promotional marketing email to existing customers, the use of specific color schemes on our application interface to make the application and our service more appealing, and finally if trying to reduce wait times and increase discounted delivery options will positively impact the level of use for our customers. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c27 c26" id="h.f2402lj87yoq"><span class="c23">Statement of the Problem</span></h4><p class="c6 c55"><span class="c1">As people continue to return to their daily practices and ways of life from before the pandemic, our services may see &nbsp;significant decrease in demand. During the pandemic people around the world were confined to their homes for an extended period of time. They needed food delivery services more than ever for meals, groceries, pharmacies and alcohol. &nbsp;In fact, there were times where wait times for orders and deliveries were higher than they had ever been due to such high levels of transactions that we had never before seen. In a time where many businesses were negatively impacted by the pandemic, and forced to terminate hundreds if not thousands of employees, our company was able to hire more employees in every facet of the business to help meet the increase in demand and continue to offer our services to the best of our ability.</span></p><p class="c6 c55"><span class="c10 c19">The prominent issue lies in the fact that as the world returns to normalcy our services may not be needed in the same way that they were during the pandemic. People are now once again free to go to restaurants and run their own errands. Our fear not only lies in the fact that their levels of activity may return to pre COVID-19 levels, but in fact may spike even more than prior to the pandemic because people may now appreciate more than ever the freedom that comes with this independence and know that in one instant, they may lose the ability to perform these activities. As a result, our services may see a significant reduction and thus our business will take a massive hit. As a result, we are constantly hoping and needing to make improvements, and incorporate actionable strategies, in order to maximize all aspects of our business as quickly and efficiently as we can. </span><span class="c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.acphizvohidl"><span class="c23">Research Questions, Hypotheses, and Effects</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The first research question is in New York City will emails with selected recommendations encourage users to UberEats? &nbsp;Selected recommendations including the information of the three recommended restaurants comes from users&#39; usual search and order analysis. The independent variable is whether or not users receive selected recommendation emails. The dependent variable is customers&rsquo; purchasing on UberEats.The null hypothesis is there is no relationship between receiving selected recommendation email and purchasing on UberEats in New york. Alternative hypothesis is selected recommendation email will increase customers&rsquo; purchasing on UberEats in New york. In this experiment, the effect size is 0.5. It is relatively large. It means that the mean of sales in the treatment group is 0.5 standard deviations higher than mean of sales in the control group. </span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10">Research Question 2 talks about &ldquo;Will the color green on Ubereats platform surface encourage users to purchase? &ldquo;</span><span class="c10 c71">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Independent Variable is the color of Ubereats platform switch to red, yellow, or blue. Dependent Variable is the satisfaction percentage of users. Null Hypothesis says &nbsp;the purchase rate of user is not affected by the switching color </span><span class="c10">on </span><span class="c10">Ubereats. Alternative Hypothesis shows &nbsp;The purchase rate of users is affected by the switching color on Ubereats. In this experiment, the effect size is 0.48. This is a relatively large effect size. It means that the mean change score in the treatment group is 0.48 standard deviations higher than the mean purchase rate in the control group.</span></p><p class="c39 c26 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c10">Research question 3 is &lsquo;can we increase UberEats sales in New York City by providing a shorter waiting time but more delivery charge service option&rsquo;. We believe that by providing a service option that UberEats</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;users could enjoy a shorter waiting time with a reasonable amount of delivery fee, users are more willing to use the UbeEats hence increasing the UberEats sales. </span><span class="c10">The null hypothesis is shorter waiting time but more delivery fee service wouldn&rsquo;t encourage users to use UberEats, hence not increasing UberEats sales. And the alternative hypothesis is</span><span class="c31">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">shorter waiting time but more delivery fee service would encourage users to use UberEats, hence increasing UberEats sales. In this the effect size is 0.2. </span></p><h4 class="c27 c26 c49" id="h.8iuax0hnj3ri"><span class="c23">Importance of the Study and Social Impact</span></h4><p class="c26 c39"><span class="c1">When our community was struck by covid pandemic, many industries were impacted heavily and closed. But UberEats delivery platforms were able to thrive due to increased need when isolated at home. However, as we recover from lock-down, we are losing customers faster than ever before. By analyzing the potential benefits from changing color, marketing email, and delivery services, it suggests the food delivery organization can recover from the pandemic as well as the food providers. It is a challenge for the whole industry to shift their sales strategies and adapt to the rapidly changing society. In the process of switching strategies among the organization, it also promotes logistical thinking in marketing, and urges the community to progress. This influence can suggest how an organization was impacted by social unrest, and it can also be a model to learn from by other organizations, and help them strive under the pandemic. What&rsquo;s more, the strategic changes can also promote inter-organization cooperation, and help each other by sharing information or resources together, which can further imply a transition in our business format. </span></p><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.515qnlatdcvx"><span class="c23">Literature Review</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c19 c26">Joseph &amp; Robert mentioned that red is most likely to be seen as a tense, negative and physically stimulating factor, because it&rsquo;s defined as a warm color, whereas blue is the opposite, being defined as a cool color that can be perceived as calm and having positive symbolism. Sometimes the color environment has a strong influence on the outcomes of purchasing decisions therefore, it is meaningful to examine the influence of the color environment on customers&#39; behavior in the retail environment and the possible connection between them. In the past, environmental factors were always neglected in the marketing area, because environmental factors are an often-silent language and frequently have little impact on business. Nevertheless, nowadays more companies are starting to recognize the significant and influential part of the environment&rsquo;s effect on customer behavior and investigate customers&rsquo; intentions. The appropriate usage of color will not only draw the customer&rsquo;s attention but can also effectively increase their purchasing intention. Despite the preference for color, </span><span class="c10 c18">Bellizzi et al </span><span class="c10 c26 c19">claimed that a retail environment in red will stimulate customers&rsquo; buying behavior and enhance their buying consideration in physiological and psychological ways, because red is a warm color which may cause the mood to be stimulated (</span><span class="c10 c18">Bellizzi et al</span><span class="c10 c26 c19">, 2022). However, subsequent to the experiment, the data revealed that average spending on the red-colored platform was much less than the average spending on a blue platform. In addition, the researcher discovered that there is no direct connection between the color treatment and length of shopping time. While customers spent more time in the red store, the blue store&rsquo;s customer spending was far greater, because the customers in the blue store preferred to purchase higher price sets. Therefore, in a business environment, red is far more distracting than blue, but </span><span class="c10 c18">Bellizzi et al </span><span class="c10 c26 c19">also mentioned that several factors such as age, education and income still remain to be considered. &nbsp;In Experiment 2, </span><span class="c10 c18">Bellizzi et al </span><span class="c1 c26">hypothesized that the purchase intention in the red environment will be less than the blue environment due to the higher stimulation and negative evaluations that tend to enhance anxiety. On the contrary, the blue environment produces a more pleasurable feeling in customers. Therefore the customers in the blue store gave more positive feedback, with their greater desire to purchase products as they have a more pleasurable feeling while shopping </span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c1 c26"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c26">What&rsquo;s more, Simms Jenkins mentioned in his book, The Truth about Email Marketing, that the proper estimated return for every dollar spent on email marketing should be $46. Email marketing delivered the most return among all internet investment strategies. Versatility is the icon of email marketing as no matter what size your company is, email marketing can always fit in the company&rsquo;s needs and bring the same benefit just like others. Jenkins also mentioned that recommendation email can help you communicate with your customers and build up loyalty if used properly. A long-term relationship can be developed between the companies and their customers, which according to Jenkins is the real benefit of email marketing. Another characteristic of email marketing is audience targeting. If companies got customers&rsquo; information regarding gender, age, interests and much more personal info, email marketing can be modified to fit their habits and needs which further increase the investment return. Moreover, email is also the fastest way &nbsp;to reach out customers and respond with actions immediately. According to Jenikins, email marketing&rsquo;s ROI index is 70% higher than any other direct-response marketing vehicle, and over 60% of business owners said that the email is the best way for advertisers and customers to reach out. Despite the marketing email and the color of the platform, the waiting time for delivery is also an important factor for customer satisfaction. Davis and Heineke found in their study that customers are less tolerable during lunch time compared to dinner time, because the duration of lunch is limited. Davis and Heineke claim that the waiting time for customers is subjective, which is based on customer&rsquo;s experience, background and value. Therefore, customers&rsquo; tolerance for waiting times is various in different situations. Usually customers recognize the waiting time as an economic and physical cost. Therefore, the customer&#39;s attitude towards waiting is important for the delivery platform&rsquo;s profit and sustainable operation, and also, it could be a detrimental factor for many delivery platform companies. </span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c1 c26"></span></p><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.y2pwwbupk00d"><span class="c23">Research Plan</span></h4><p class="c60 c26"><span class="c31">Q1:</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Will emails with selected recommendations encourage users to use </span><span class="c10 c19">UberEats</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in New York city?</span></p><p class="c60 c26"><span class="c10">All of the people who have and used </span><span class="c10 c19">UberEats</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;are the target audience. We want to randomly select people from the </span><span class="c10 c19">UberEats</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;registered users as experimental subjects to carry out our study. We are going to randomly select 100 registered users as our subjects for this trail. Because our team wanted to find out if sending a selected recommendation email to users would increase their purchases in </span><span class="c10 c19">UberEats</span><span class="c0">. Thus, we would like to split 100 subjects into two groups equally. </span></p><p class="c60 c26"><span class="c10">One group&rsquo;s users will not receive any recommendation emails. It will be counted as a control group. The other group will receive selected recommendation emails from </span><span class="c10 c19">UberEats</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to promote their products. This group will be counted as an examined group. We set the same amount of time to do the experiment. We looked at the volume of orders placed by two groups on UberEats to determine whether selected recommendation &nbsp;emails stimulated consumer spending. If people who receive the marketing email order significantly more than those who don&#39;t, then the email method is working, and vice versa. The planned duration of the experiment is 1 month, and the frequency of the ad email push is one every three days. The content will be the recommended restaurants, menu and promotion information of the UberEats&rsquo; partner merchants. We will target these 100 users on app and continue to track their orders after the experiment begins. In particular, we will observe the comparison between the two groups in terms of the number of orders placed a few days after the email push. The experiment will be conducted in a month-long cycle, where users in the experimental group will receive an email about the week&#39;s recommendations every Monday. At the end of the experiment we compare the data through the UberEats backend.The dependent variable is customers&rsquo; purchasing on Ubereats. The independent variable is whether or not users received email. </span></p><p class="c26 c60"><span class="c0">All of the data during the experiment will be collected directly by UberEats.We will train the staff involved in this trial (both our group and those on the Uber side) to ensure that all personal information of subjects is not released to the public and all data and information for this test only.</span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c30 c31 c70"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c31">Q2: </span><span class="c10">Will the color red on App platform surface encourage users to purchase? </span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Users of takeout food ordering apps are the target audience. Which ordering app would they use, when, and why? By enhancing the interaction design of the website as if the predominant hue were either red or blue, our objective should be to ascertain whether this would assist us in luring more users to the take-out app. The feasibility of answering the research questions before the study even starts depends on sample selection, a crucial component of the study design. To investigate if a page&#39;s color changes make people want to eat more, we can choose 1000 people at random from the population who frequently order takeout. Choosing the number of observations or replications to be included in the statistical sample is referred to as choosing the sample size. 1000 customers who commonly order takeout were chosen for this trial.</span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c30 c31 c70"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this study, the effect of red as a theme color used in a setting associated to takeout software was examined. &nbsp;&ldquo;Generally, warm colors (red and yellow) have produced opposite physiological and psychological effects than cool colors (blue and green), which are opposite on the color spectrum.&rdquo; (Bellizzi, J., &amp; Hite, R, 348). &nbsp;Due to their opposing color qualities, red was chosen as the test group whereas green might have served as the control. On the other hand, green is seen to be peaceful and natural. There were two lab tests performed. Both studies used mostly red or green to imitate the takeout software&#39;s color environment. To verify if people increased their willingness to consume as a result of the varied impacts of red and green, these two studies were required. The research sought to determine whether the green or red environments produced the more favorable outcomes. The findings must reveal if a factor like color, which elicits strong emotions, influences a customer&#39;s propensity to purchase.</span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10">Research in the field of data security finds any safety measures required to keep records private and secure. Customers may view the growth rate of purchases right away in UberEats&#39; back office. &ldquo;</span><span class="c10 c26">Much like Coca-Cola&#39;s secret recipe that is locked away in a vault, Hershey&#39;s secret lab that concocts its famous Kisses and KFC&#39;s famous yet unknown 11 herbs and spices, it is crucial to keep certain data from prying eyes&hellip; Multiple employees, stakeholders and partners need access to the data that enterprises value so highly. But more people having access means more chances for things to go wrong.&rdquo; (Shea, 1). </span><span class="c0">The technology division can also adjust the hue of the platform. Additionally, researchers should get training and certification. They must understand how to effectively use user data while staying within the bounds of what is permitted by law. Both structured and unstructured data repositories, such as databases, data warehouses, big data platforms, and cloud environments, may include sensitive information. Solutions for data discovery and categorization can automate the procedure for locating sensitive data as well as for evaluating and addressing issues. Risk analysis and vulnerability assessment instruments. These technologies make it easier to find vulnerabilities like out-of-date software, incorrect setups, and weak passwords, as well as to identify the data sources that are most at risk.</span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Dependent Variable is the satisfaction percentage of users. Customer satisfaction can be measured for each participant in the study, and this is a quantifiable value for easy comparison. Independent Variable is the color of Ubereats platform switch to red, yellow, or blue. Experiments were conducted using the red ubereats interface in the treatment group of 500 individuals and the green interface in the control group of 500 individuals. The two control groups were used to help the study determine which color interface had a greater impact on people and increased their consumption of ubereats.</span></p><p class="c16 c52"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c31 c19">Research Question 3</span><span class="c10 c19">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;can we increase UberEats sales in New York City by providing a shorter waiting time but more delivery fee option&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">For research question 3, key components of the research design are addressed below. There have been studies showing that factors, such as delivery service experience and price, would significantly influence customer intention to use food delivery apps. Price is defined as the payment that customers paid to exchange for a service or product. The delivery service experience is defined as the waiting time shown on the app/website when the user places an order online. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">The population of interest is all existing or potential UberEats users. The sample selection is randomly selecting existing New York UberEats users who are active in the past 3 three months (meaning they ordered a food delivery to a New York address). The sample size would be 620. The operational procedure would be to send out questionnaires to 620 users from the treatment group and ask them to answer the question regarding an option, &lsquo;Will you like to speed up your order with a reasonable price&rsquo;. The questionnaire will state if the user selects this option, he/she would receive a 10% increase in the delivery fee and a 10% decrease in waiting time. The questionnaire will also state that the &lsquo;10% decrease in waiting time is an approximation but we are positive that the delivery time will be decreased since we have a separate team of drivers who only do their deliveries&rsquo;. It will also give respondents a real-life example, such as &#39;Alice lives in Queens and ordered a brunch from a diner in Manhattan. By paying only 3 dollars more in delivery fee, she saved 10 mins of her waiting time&#39;. The Brief schedule: will be that we send out questionnaires in one month in order to make sure users from the sample group will receive the email on the same day. Then, we will give them one month to fill out the survey. For those users who failed to open the email 2 weeks after we sent out the email. We will send a reminder email to them. &nbsp;Data collection: all response data will be collected, as well as each respondent&rsquo;s &nbsp;id, zip code, past purchase history. &nbsp;Data security: we will cooperate with the UberEats marketing department because they have sufficient experience in marketing survey, email marketing and how to ensure user data security. Also, we will make sure that only people from the research team will have access to the survey data. Right now, for this question, the independent variable (treatment) is whether UberEats users would choose this service. The dependent variable(outcome) is UberEats sales ($). The other variables are response time and other responders&rsquo; information(zip code, past purchase history). </span></p><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.bs4zs1ehd1tk"><span class="c35 c33 c43">Statistical Analysis Plan</span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c1">This dataset is based on the usage data of the app and building a statistical model that can be obtained. The goal is to build a model where the statistics are P-value and RMSE which will be used to analyze the given data (root mean square error). the lower the RMSE, the better the model. I first imported the dataset and then eliminated the redundant characters from the genre values. Using the genres present in the training and scoring data, we divided the genres into vectors and created dummy variables from the columns of the genre vectors. To ensure that both sets of data have the same number of columns, the training and scoring data were encoded. Once the classification and data cleaning is complete, I will divide the dataset into two modules, training and testing, for most regression prediction analysis. Even if some features cannot be utilized because they overfit the training set or exhibit multicollinearity with each other, feature selection typically goes beyond baselines, adjustments, and ensembles, allowing you to employ as many features as possible. For example, in this statistic, one of the features we can use to promote RMSE is &#39;genre&#39;.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">We utilize $220 as the average monthly sales per user as the population mean (no effect group mean). We want to see how the average monthly sales per user would be improved, &nbsp;responding to the new strategy provided. </span></p><h4 class="c27 c26" id="h.evfncwsl2ch8"><span class="c23">Sample Size and Statistical Power</span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c1">For question1, after running two-sample t test calculation, the sample size should be 100 with 50 in each control and treatment group, the effect size of 0.5, power of 0.8. We believe it&rsquo;s large enough to represent the population and a power that is significant enough to detect a deviation from the null hypothesis. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">For question 2, &nbsp;the sample size is 1000, which achieves the minimum sample size for the proposed effect size. Also the experiment clearly indicates that the sample size of the study can meet the minimum sample draw for the New York area. In the random sampling, the sample is freely selected in the Ubereats. Because the Baseline conversion rate of this experiment is 20%, the Minimum Detectable Effect is 5%, the Statistical power is 80%, and the significance level is 5%. So the experiment considers the sample size to be 1000 This is also consistent with the statistical power of the organization. For Statistical Power the selection is 80%</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">For question 3, the sample size is 620 with 310 in each control and treatment group, effect size of 0.2(hence the treatment group mean is 222) , power of 0.8. After running two-sample t test power calculation, and considering that we want a sample size that it&rsquo;s large enough to represent the population and a power that is significant enough to detect a deviation from the null hypothesis. </span></p><p class="c6 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.r96ss6v8m5cf"><span class="c23">Possible Recommendations</span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Q1: the p-value=0.00825 which is much less than 0.05. It is statistically significant and we should reject the null hypothesis. Thus, the selected recommendation email is an effective way to encourage users to use UberEats and &nbsp;to increase customers&rsquo; purchasing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Q2: After submitting this final model, the p-value run through the simulation model was 0.894. It was greater than 0.05, so my judgment was to reject H0 and conclude that color does affect the popularity of the app. The conclusion drawn should be to accept the ubereats interface to change the theme color to green. The image of the brand color is engraved into the user&#39;s image. This will increase the user&#39;s dependence and trust in ubereats and consequently the frequency of use and hence the amount spent on ubereats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c19">Q3: with p-value=0.0004 &lt;0.05, it&#39;s statistically significant, and we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. So it&rsquo;s possible that </span><span class="c31 c19">s</span><span class="c1">horter waiting time but more delivery fee service would encourage users to use UberEats, hence increasing UberEats sales. If the &nbsp;average monthly sale per user could achieve the expected size ($2), this means UberEats could expect millions of dollar sales increasing per month from New York city alone. </span></p><p class="c6 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.ahzuih9nlwgb"><span class="c23">Limitations and Uncertainties</span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The area of deficiency in this experiment was cleaning and classifying the data before the model. I did not filter out the proper variables in the model. So next time, I will select only some influential variables. I will also try to use XGboost model again because it is also the best prediction model. It has probably lower RMSE, plus the previous data processing. This is something I can do better. I will try again with this method or model. In addition to the problem in data processing, the random selection of users for the Ubereats APP may not include all age groups and user groups in the sample selection. Research also needs to go further to explore the effect of color on users&#39; mental activity, rather than just drawing conclusions from statistical results. For example, how the theme color of ubereats affects customers&#39; ordering decisions.</span></p><p class="c6 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c40" id="h.u138n57q59lb"><span class="c12">Part 2: Simulation of Effects</span></h3><h4 class="c27 c49 c26" id="h.w1t9wfk4e5gm"><span class="c23">Scenarios</span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c19">Q1: No effect.
